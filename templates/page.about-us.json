That’s when fueled by her parents' struggles, Palak embarked on a mission to uncover the root cause of their suffering, which is where…<br\/><br\/>Her tireless research led to a startling discovery - the lack of essential nutrition, poor lifestyle, and neglectful dietary habits caused the problem at the root.<br\/><br\/>With this newfound information, she took charge of her parents' lives, transforming their diet and lifestyle completely and also, introducing them to meticulously crafted supplements, formulated with the finest ingredients backed by her rigorous research and…<br\/><br\/>… Miraculously, within just 3 months, her parents had made a 40% recovery, progressing each day.<br\/><br\/>Seeing the remarkable transformations of her parents, Palak realized that she could have a nationwide impact. This is when she alongside her brother,<strong>Pranav Midha<\/strong>, who sacrificed his American career, came together to build this<strong>gigantic empire<\/strong>and that’s what gave birth to<strong>\"MIDUTY\" - INDIA’S MOST TRUSTED NUTRACEUTICAL COMPANY<\/strong>, offering organic and wholesome supplements with the mission of not just transforming your physical well-being but also empowering you to cherish your beauty and confidence.<\/p>",
